also be available when they come back it has to go into a database. Otherwise he information would be lost. A database allows multiple users

A database can have multiple tables that all contain information. If we are a shop we might have information in our clients in one table and information on purchases in another. We can connect these together by having the client ID as a columns in the purchases table. 
The columns represent the characteristics of for example our clients. So maybe there are columns for first name, last name, phone number, etc.
And each row represents a customer. In each cell there are values. For example the phone number of a specific customer.
