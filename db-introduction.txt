A database is always used when it is necessary to store data for your app or website. So whenever people input information that should
also be available when they come back it has to go into a database. Otherwise he information would be lost. A database allows multiple users
at the same time to retrieve and store data. A text file is for local use on your computer.

SQL uses a single = to make comparisions whereas other languages use double ==. 

Another difference is that SQL is declarative and not procedural. We don't tell how something should be find but we describe what we want. Thats why the SQL statements almost read like english: I want these columns from this table but only those entries that are smaller than 100 in column x. OR something like that.

I am still a bit unsure about this question because it feels like that the answer is the same as for question 5.
Anyway, the database can hold dozens of tables that all can be interlinked with keys. All information should only be stored once so it makes sense to organize information in various tables. For purchases I don't always need to store all the information about the customer in the purchase. I can just give the customerID which links it to the customer information. So all my tables hold my data and each table has rows and columns. Each column is a feature of that customer or purchase or whatever it is. And each row represents one individual customer or purchase for example.

A database can have multiple tables that all contain information. If we are a shop we might have information in our clients in one table and information on purchases in another. We can connect these together by having the client ID as a columns in the purchases table. 
The columns represent the characteristics of for example our clients. So maybe there are columns for first name, last name, phone number, etc.
And each row represents a customer. In each cell there are values. For example the phone number of a specific customer.
