INSERT INTO command

UPDATE command

DELETE command

2.
INSERT INTO tablename (id, size)
VALUES
(12, 'large'),
(13, 'medium');

After the INSERT INTO command you state the table name and then the columns that you insert. After the keyword VALUES the values to be inserted follow. Here we create two new rows in the table. 

UPDATE tablename SET size='large' WHERE id=13;

After the UPDATE command we state the tablename and then after the SET keyword we change size to large where the id is 13.

DELETE FROM tablename where id=13;

After the DELETE FROM command we state the tablename and then a condition.

3.
We can use the data type 'time' to store a time for example of an observation of the temperature. 
We can use data type DECIMAL to store the temperature. 
We can use VARCHAR(1) to store either F or C. This will only allow one character to be stored. 

4.
First and last name would be VARCHAR(n) with a high limit to allow for long names. 
RSVP would be a BOOLEAN to hold either true or false.
Number of guests would be an INTEGER. 
Number of meals a DECIMAL to allow for .5 values.

CREATE TABLE invitations (
  firstName varchar(64),
  lastName varchar(64),
  RSVP boolean,
  noOfGuests integer,
  noOfMeals decimal
);

ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN thankYou boolean SET DEFAULT false;

ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN noOfMeals;

ALTER TABLE invitations ADD COLUMN table integer SET DEFAULT 'None';

ALTER TABLE invitations DROP COLUMN table;

I don't know whether that depends on the fact that I am working on a European machine but I enter dates as 'dd/mm/yyyy' and it turns out correct.
